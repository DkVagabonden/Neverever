# Neverever
This is a small "Never Have I Ever" html/css game-project. 

I made this because i am learning to code and i just wanted to make something.

On my way to learn html5,css3 and php5.

Website is responsive.
=======
Responsive and it gets questions from mysql database.
You can make your own question in the database table "svar" itself or in the "Login" folder if running on a server (for php).


To make a new question go to /login
Type in the new question and hit send.


This will automatic send the question to the mysql database.
=======
Translation for english will come soon.

EVERYTHING IS IN DANISH RIGHT NOW!
